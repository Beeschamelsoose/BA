This project implements an embedded monitoring system for evaluating formic acid treatments in honeybee hives.
It continuously measures temperature, humidity, and acid concentration, storing the data for subsequent analysis.
The system is designed to operate autonomously for approximately two weeks. Measurement data can be retrieved at any time via UART in CSV format.

The released version corresponds to the validated software used in the bachelor’s thesis and provides a reproducible environment for future research and development.
